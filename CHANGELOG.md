## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- **Native Swift/SwiftUI rewrite**: Complete rewrite from Electron/Rust to pure Swift/SwiftUI + Go for video processing
- **Screen recording**: Full screen and window recording via ScreenCaptureKit
  - Floating control pill with pause/resume, stop, and discard controls
  - Pulsing red dot indicator with MM:SS timer
  - HEVC encoding at 60fps Retina resolution
  - Post-recording compression via videokit (FFmpeg)
  - Recordings saved to user's configured save directory
- **Preview overlay with editor access**: Floating preview card appears after capture
  - Hover to reveal actions: edit (pencil), delete, dismiss
  - Copy and Save pill buttons
  - Draggable thumbnail
  - Clicking pencil icon opens the annotation editor
- **Annotation editor window**: Opens from preview overlay with full beautifier controls
  - Switches app to regular activation policy (visible in Dock/Cmd-Tab) while editing
- **Override macOS screenshot shortcuts**:
  - Cmd+Shift+3 = Capture Screen
  - Cmd+Shift+4 = Capture Region
  - Cmd+Shift+5 = Capture Window
  - Cmd+Shift+6 = Toggle Screen Recording
  - Cmd+Shift+O = OCR Region
- **Bundled background images**: Wallpapers, mesh gradients, and macOS assets now ship inside the app bundle
- **videokit bundled**: Go-based FFmpeg wrapper included in the app for video compression

### Fixed

- **Background images not loading in editor**: Resources weren't being copied into the app bundle; fixed project config and file lookup to use direct path construction
- **Screenshot sound**: Now plays the actual macOS screenshot sound (`Screen Capture.aif`) instead of the generic "Blow" sound
- **Editor image caching**: Added `.onChange(of: imageURL)` and `.id()` to prevent stale images when editor window is reused

### Changed

- App target deployment raised to macOS 14.0
- Swift 6 strict concurrency throughout

## [0.1.0] - Previous

### Added

- **Background Border slider**: Adjustable padding around screenshots (0–200px)
- **Frontend test framework**: Vitest with React Testing Library (19 tests)
- **Rust unit tests**: CropRegion bounds, filename generation (13 tests)

### Fixed

- Background visible at 0px border setting

### Changed

- Padding now stored in EditorSettings (previously hardcoded to 100px)
