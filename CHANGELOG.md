## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- **In-app update checker**: Check for Updates button in Preferences > About that queries GitHub releases API and links to the latest download
- **Version tracking**: `version.json` file at project root for release management
- **Professional annotation system**: Complete rewrite of annotation tools, adapted from Screendrop's implementation
  - **Interactive canvas**: Annotations render as live SwiftUI views — click to select, drag to move, handles to resize
  - **Selection system**: Single select, multi-select (Shift/Cmd+click), marquee drag selection, select all (Cmd+A)
  - **Curved arrows**: Quadratic Bézier arrows with draggable curve control handle and snap-to-straight
  - **Live text editing**: Text annotations use inline NSTextView with full font family, size, bold/italic/underline, and alignment controls
  - **Numbered circles**: Auto-incrementing numbered badges with proper outline and contrast text
  - **Redaction tools**: Pixelate and blur with adjustable density slider and cached preview generation
  - **Resize handles**: Corner handles for shapes, endpoint handles for lines/arrows, curve handle for arrows
  - **Keyboard shortcuts**: Single-key tool switching (R/O/T/L/A/P/B/1/H), Delete to remove, Cmd+Z/Shift+Cmd+Z for undo/redo
  - **Color picker**: 10 named color presets with popover selector + custom ColorPicker
  - **Stroke width picker**: Visual popover with 5 presets (2/4/6/8/12px)
- **Aspect-ratio locking**: Hold Shift while drawing rectangles/ellipses to constrain to square/circle
- **Arrow snap-to-straight**: Arrow curves snap to a straight line when dragged near the start-end axis

### Fixed

- **Menu bar icon**: Replaced generic circle template icon with the actual BetterShot app icon (orange ring) using original rendering
- **Keyboard shortcut override**: Fixed the accessibility permission flow — the CGEvent tap now only registers after accessibility permission is confirmed, with polling to detect when the user grants permission
- **Annotation coordinate system**: Gesture tracking now normalizes against the actual image display rect (accounting for aspect-fit letterboxing), not the full view bounds

### Changed

- **Inspector panel redesigned**: Sidebar with sections for Tools, Style, Text, Effects, and Background — each with proper spacing, section headers, and dividers
- **Canvas rendering**: Annotations now render directly as SwiftUI views on the canvas (not baked into a preview image), enabling real-time interaction without re-render delays
- **Live beautifier preview**: Canvas shows the full rendered preview (background, padding, shadow, corner radius) with a 30ms debounced render pipeline
- Version bumped to 0.3.0
- Deployment target remains macOS 14.0
- Simplified BetterShotDelegate — removed all video recording callback and frame extraction code

### Removed

- **Screen recording**: Removed ScreenRecorder, VideoProcessor, RecordingControlPanel, and the bundled videokit binary — video features will return in a future release
- **Layout section**: Removed alignment grid and aspect ratio picker from the editor inspector (non-functional in previous release)
- **Old annotation system**: Replaced `ColorSwatch`, `StrokeWidth` enum, `AnnotationGestureView`, and basic `AnnotationItem` with the full interactive model

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- **Native Swift/SwiftUI rewrite**: Complete rewrite from Electron/Rust to pure Swift/SwiftUI + Go for video processing
- **Screen recording**: Full screen and window recording via ScreenCaptureKit
  - Floating control pill with pause/resume, stop, and discard controls
  - Pulsing red dot indicator with MM:SS timer
  - HEVC encoding at 60fps Retina resolution
  - Post-recording compression via videokit (FFmpeg)
  - Recordings saved to user's configured save directory
- **Preview overlay with editor access**: Floating preview card appears after capture
  - Hover to reveal actions: edit (pencil), delete, dismiss
  - Copy and Save pill buttons
  - Draggable thumbnail
  - Clicking pencil icon opens the annotation editor
- **Annotation editor window**: Opens from preview overlay with full beautifier controls
  - Switches app to regular activation policy (visible in Dock/Cmd-Tab) while editing
- **Override macOS screenshot shortcuts**:
  - Cmd+Shift+3 = Capture Screen
  - Cmd+Shift+4 = Capture Region
  - Cmd+Shift+5 = Capture Window
  - Cmd+Shift+6 = Toggle Screen Recording
  - Cmd+Shift+O = OCR Region
- **Bundled background images**: Wallpapers, mesh gradients, and macOS assets now ship inside the app bundle
- **videokit bundled**: Go-based FFmpeg wrapper included in the app for video compression

### Fixed

- **Background images not loading in editor**: Resources weren't being copied into the app bundle; fixed project config and file lookup to use direct path construction
- **Screenshot sound**: Now plays the actual macOS screenshot sound (`Screen Capture.aif`) instead of the generic "Blow" sound
- **Editor image caching**: Added `.onChange(of: imageURL)` and `.id()` to prevent stale images when editor window is reused

### Changed

- App target deployment raised to macOS 14.0
- Swift 6 strict concurrency throughout

## [0.1.0] - Previous

### Added

- **Background Border slider**: Adjustable padding around screenshots (0–200px)
- **Frontend test framework**: Vitest with React Testing Library (19 tests)
- **Rust unit tests**: CropRegion bounds, filename generation (13 tests)

### Fixed

- Background visible at 0px border setting

### Changed

- Padding now stored in EditorSettings (previously hardcoded to 100px)
