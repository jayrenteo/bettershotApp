## Key Features

### Capture
- Region, fullscreen, and window screenshot via native macOS screencapture CLI
- OCR text extraction + QR code / barcode detection (Apple Vision framework)
- Color picker — sample any on-screen pixel, copies hex to clipboard

### Beautify
- Backgrounds: 12 solid color presets, 16 gradient presets, bundled macOS wallpapers, custom images
- Effects: padding, corner radius, shadow strength — all rendered live
- Layout: aspect ratio (Auto, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 16:9, 9:16), 9-point alignment grid with smart corner radius
- Export as PNG or JPEG with configurable quality

### Annotate
- Tools: rectangle, filled rectangle, ellipse, line, curved arrow, freehand, text, numbered badge, blur, spotlight
- Single-key shortcuts for each tool (R, F, O, L, A, D, T, N, B, G)
- Text annotations with font selection, size, bold, italic, underline, alignment
- Blur/pixelate redaction with adjustable density

### Workflow

- Toast notifications for save, copy, OCR, and color picker feedback
- Configurable overlay position and auto-dismiss timing
